<h2>About <span class="lead fs-2">Selvakumaran Krishnan</span></h2>
<hr/>
<p>I am a dedicated professional with a strong passion for web design, online publishing, blog writing, programming, SEO, digital marketing, and framework development.</p>

<p>My journey began in 2008 when I started exploring various Web 2.0 platforms and quickly developed a keen interest in web design. In 2014, I expanded my expertise into programming, and since then, I have closely followed the evolution of open-source libraries, tools, themes, templates, datasets, plugins, widgets, and frameworks that shape the web development landscape.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have successfully managed a wide range of freelance projects, including developing WordPress sites, implementing SEO strategies, executing digital marketing campaigns, and creating web-based products. My commitment to staying at the forefront of industry trends enables me to deliver innovative and high-quality solutions for every project.</p>
